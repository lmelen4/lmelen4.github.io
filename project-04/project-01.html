    <h> Project 1: A Poem</h>
    
 <p>This is the first project that we did in class. We had to create a poem of our choosing and I chose to do it on dogs. I chose dogs because I have a dog of my own and she is my world. She makes me smile and she ws the first thing that I thought of when thinking of this project. In my opinon, any person loves animals especially dogs.</p>

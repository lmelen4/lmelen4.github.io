This is my second project. For this specific project we had to create a backdrop or have a green screen and record ourselves moving, talking, and making sure that it stays up for the entire video. We were allowed to talk about why we chose the greenscreen that we chose and I decided to choose the picture of me and my two nephews, Logan and Josiah because they are always with me and they are my world as well. In the video, I also show my dog Chanel. I talk about them and explain who they are, their name, age, and how they act. I felt like this was reasonable and a good start for someone who had never used a greenscreen and had to record myself as well.

  <p>Hello everyone, my name is Leslie Melendez. I am a senior at UIC majoring in Disability and Human Development. I decided to take this class in the beginning of spring semester as a gen-ed. This class was just supposed to be for fun but I actually learned how to do some coding. It has been kind of difficult at first but I think I got the hang of some of the easy parts of it. So, here are some of the projects that I have made using the coding that i have learned including this one. They may not be much, but I feel like as a beginner it is pretty good. 
    <p>This is my the first project that I have done. If you want to check it out, click on this <a href="project-01.html">link</a></p>
      <p>This is my second project that I did. If you want to check it out, click on this <a href="project-02.html">link</a></p>
        <p>This is my third project that I did. If you want to check it out, click on this <a href="project-03.html">link</a></p>
          <p> These are the projects that I have done since I have started this class. I hope you guys enjoyed the project that I have done and came up with! Thank you so much for checking them out.
